A fork of the Cider v1 player, aimed to maintaining it to be happily running upon Linux desktop, with some fixes not in the original upstream.

## FAQ

### Breaking changes

#### Name changes

The "DesktopEntry" property of MPRIS requires a fixed desktop file name. As I have no idea how to manually specify desktop file name with `electron-builder`, I have to change binary name, and following changes are made:

- `cider.desktop` -> `sh.cider.Cider.desktop`
- (desktop entry icon) `cider` -> `sh.cider.Cider`
- `cider` binary -> `sh.cider.Cider` binary

### Account

#### Blank screen / no login window

This Cider build (and other third party apps supporting Apple Music) requires a valid Apple Music **token** (not account!) to work. Unfortunately, this is costly: an [Apple Developer Program subscription](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) is required to generate a valid token ($99 USD per year). Please read <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/generating_developer_tokens> for more information.

Note that currently you could get others' token with `MusicKit.getInstance().developerToken` on webpages using [MusicKit](https://developer.apple.com/musickit/). Please refrain from using this in production (such as packaging it in your own apps). See <https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/702228> for more discussion, and thanks for a user's email informing me about this.

This build by default still requires <https://api.cider.sh/v1/> returning a working, valid token -- currently I could not help with this if it does not work :-(.

You could press "Ctrl+Shift+I" to open devtools, switch to "Console" tab, and see if there's any error message related to, for example, expired token.

This build supports `TOKEN_API` env, which you could provide a custom API endpoint to fetch the token like this:

```sh
TOKEN_API=https://example.com/token flatpak run sh.cider.Cider  # or ./cider, or anything you like
```

`TOKEN_API` requires returning a JSON object with `token` like this:

```json
{
  "token": "xxxx"
}
```

To persist this, you could edit the `.desktop` file installed (`Exec` line). If you're using Flatpak, use [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) to add this environment variable.

### Flatpak

#### Why does it require --device=all in the Flatpak manifest?

Currently, FIDO2 support with Flatpak is a bit messy -- FIDO2 requires USB accesses, and currently the only way to do that is to allow it to access **all** devices.

Portal support is still in development slowly:

- <https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/989>
- <https://alfioemanuele.io/dev/2024/01/31/a-vision-for-passkeys-on-the-linux-desktop.html>

If you don't have a security key, you can change `--device=all` to `--device=dri` (GPU access is still required for hardware acceleration), with tools like Flatseal.

### Building

#### `libcrypto.so.1` not found

`electron-builder` requires OpenSSL 1.1 for now.

For distros that using OpenSSL 3.x, you need to install OpenSSL 1.1 compatibility libraries. For example, on Arch Linux, you can install `libxcrypt-compat` package.
